# Travel Advantage Network
## Site Updates Repository

### Introduction

This is my development environment to produce a dummy version of the
Travel Advantage Network. It is written in PHP to help reduce loads
of repetitive code. You can find the functioning version of this project
at [http://tan.owlwatch.com](http://tan.owlwatch.com)

For implementation purposes, the important directories are `assets` and `templates`.
The markup has been broken into multiple files to help with organization
and code reuse. The PHP is fairly minimal, so these individual templates
should be useful on their own. To get straight HTML, you can visit the
site above and simply view the source.
